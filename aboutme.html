        <p class="desc">I am an innovative student currently studying computer engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am searching four month co-op for the fall and feel as though I would be a valuable addition to your team. I am a quick learner and am eager for a job opportunity that allows me to further my knowledge. 
            For my previous co-op term, I worked as a backend developer at IBM where I implemented a feature that allowed for the automation of repetitive tasks through defining APIs and internal schemas.
            I am extremely interested in different aspects of software development, particularly in iOS development. I used online courses to get a better understanding of Swift and Xcode so that I could make my own apps. Currently, I have independently created an app that is now on the App Store (Link to the app: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/evil-cookie/id1478649765) and am working on a new app with a UX designer. 
            In addition to the Swift course, I have taken the Machine Learning course on Coursera, and programming courses on Java and C++ throughout my education. I am excited to expand my expertise and learn more about software and programming through work experience. 
            Thank you for taking the time to review my résumé and I hope to meet you.
